ERROR: ❌ Error validating data: Trying to convert dd.Scalar<series-..., dtype=bool> to a boolean value. Because Dask objects are lazily evaluated, they cannot be converted to a boolean value or used in boolean conditions like if statements. Try calling .compute() to force computation prior to converting to a boolean value or using in a conditional statement.
